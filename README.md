# Touchpad Gesture Customization #

This extension modifies and extends existing touchpad gestures on GNOME using Wayland. This project is a fork of [gnome-gesture-improvements](https://github.com/harshadgavali/gnome-gesture-improvements). Since the original project seems to be no longer maintained, I setup this project with the aim of taking over the development and maintenance of this wonderful extension that I relied on for daily use.

**Note**:
- To view the extension's settings window, user need to install ```extensions``` app.
- I have removed the support for X11 since I only use Wayland, but this can be added again in the future if needed and if someone is willing to support this.

#### For activating snapping/tiling gesture (inverted T gesture)

1. Do a 3/4-fingers vertical swipe downward gesture on an unmaximized window but don't release the gesture
2. Wait a few milliseconds
3. Do a 3/4-fingers horizontal swipe gesture to tile a window to either side of the screen

#### For activating application gesture

1. Activate a 3/4-fingers hold gesture on touchpad by pressing your fingers on touchpad but don't release the gesture
2. Wait a few milliseconds
3. Do a 3/4-fingers vertical/horizontal swipe gesture to activate the application gesture (an arrow animation circle will appear)

#### Application Gesture Notes

- For horizontal gestures, application gesture only works if 3/4-fingers horizontal swipe is set to **Window Switching**
- Application gesture also supports vertical swipe but is still experimental and requires users to turn off other actions for 3/4-fingers vertical swipe (i.e. set the action to None).

#### Notes

- Enabling minimizing window gesture for Window Manipulation will disable snapping/tiling gesture.
- If you are using an older version of GNOME, there might be a bug which prevent the extension from detecting **hold and swipe gesture** and **pinch gesture**. If you face this problem, the gesture can only work if the mouse pointer is pointed at the desktop or top panel.

## Customization

- To switch to windows from _all_ workspaces using 3-fingers swipes, run

```
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.window-switcher current-workspace-only false
```
